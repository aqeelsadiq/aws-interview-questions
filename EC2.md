### 1. What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to create, configure, and manage virtual servers (known as instances) in the AWS cloud.
### 2. What are the different instance types in EC2?
Amazon EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose, memory-optimized, compute-optimized, and GPU instances.
### 3.  Explain the differences between on-demand, reserved, and spot instances.
On-Demand Instances: Pay-as-you-go pricing with no upfront commitment.
Reserved Instances: Provides capacity reservation at a lower cost in exchange for a commitment.
Spot Instances: Allows users to bid on unused EC2 capacity, potentially leading to significantly lower costs.
### 4. What is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)?
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template that contains the information required to launch an EC2 instance. AMIs can include an operating system, applications, data, and configuration settings.
### 5. Explain the difference between public IP and Elastic IP in EC2.
A public IP is assigned to an instance at launch, but it can change if the instance is stopped and started. An Elastic IP is a static IP address that can be associated with an instance, providing a consistent public IP even after stopping and starting the instance.
### 6. What is Amazon EBS?
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances. EBS volumes can be attached to instances and used as data storage.
### 7. What is the difference between instance store and EBS-backed instances?
Instance store instances use ephemeral storage that is directly attached to the instance, providing high I/O performance. EBS-backed instances use EBS volumes for storage, offering persistent data storage.
