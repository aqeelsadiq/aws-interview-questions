### 1. What is Amazon RDS?
Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that simplifies database setup, operation, and scaling. It supports various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

### 2. How does Amazon RDS work?
Amazon RDS automates common database management tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling. It allows you to focus on your application without managing the underlying infrastructure.

### 3. What are the key features of Amazon RDS?
Amazon RDS offers automated backups, automated software patching, high availability through Multi-AZ deployments, read replicas for scaling read operations, and the ability to create custom database snapshots.

### 4. What is Multi-AZ deployment in Amazon RDS?
Multi-AZ deployment is a feature that provides high availability by automatically maintaining a standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ). If the primary database fails, the standby replica is promoted.

### 5. How can you improve read performance in Amazon RDS?
You can improve read performance by creating read replicas. Read replicas replicate data from the primary database and can be used to distribute read traffic.

### 6. What is Amazon Aurora?
Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database engine that provides high performance, availability, and durability. It's designed to be compatible with these engines while offering improved performance and features.

### 7. What is the difference between Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB?
Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service, while Amazon DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database service. RDS supports SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, while DynamoDB is designed for fast and flexible NoSQL data storage.
