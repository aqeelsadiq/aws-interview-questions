### 1. What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and manages the infrastructure required to run your code in response to events.

### 2. How does AWS Lambda work?
You can upload your code to Lambda and define event sources that trigger the execution of your code. Lambda automatically manages the execution environment, scales it as needed, and provides monitoring and logging.

### 3. What are the key benefits of using AWS Lambda?
The benefits of AWS Lambda include automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, cost efficiency (as you pay only for the compute time used), and the ability to build event-driven architectures.

### 4. What types of events can trigger AWS Lambda functions?
AWS Lambda functions can be triggered by various event sources, such as changes in Amazon S3 objects, updates to Amazon DynamoDB tables, HTTP requests through Amazon API Gateway, and more.
