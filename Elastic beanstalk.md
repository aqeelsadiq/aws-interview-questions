1. What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that simplifies application deployment and management. It handles infrastructure provisioning, deployment, monitoring, and scaling, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

2. How does Elastic Beanstalk work?
Elastic Beanstalk abstracts the infrastructure layer, allowing you to upload your code (web application or microservices) and configuration. It then automatically deploys, manages, and scales your application based on the platform, language, and environment settings you choose.

3. What languages and platforms does Elastic Beanstalk support?
Elastic Beanstalk supports multiple programming languages and platforms, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.

4. What is an Elastic Beanstalk environment?
An Elastic Beanstalk environment is a specific instance of your application that includes the runtime, resources, and configuration settings. You can have multiple environments (e.g., development, testing, production) for the same application.

5. How does Elastic Beanstalk handle updates and deployments?
Elastic Beanstalk supports both All at Once and Rolling deployments. All at Once deploys updates to all instances simultaneously, while Rolling deploys updates in batches to reduce downtime.
6. How does Elastic Beanstalk handle automatic scaling?
Elastic Beanstalk can automatically scale your application based on the configured scaling triggers, such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or other custom metrics.

6. How can you automate deployments to Elastic Beanstalk?
You can use the AWS CodePipeline service to automate the deployment process to Elastic Beanstalk. This helps create a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.
